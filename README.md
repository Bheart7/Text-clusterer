# Text-clusterer
Text clustering is the application of unsupervised cluster analysis of the text-based documents. One of the subfields that deals with text clustering is Natural Language Processing (NLP). Nowadays, texts such as chat messages, emails, reports etc are the most abundant data in the world. But one of the problems regarding texts is not having proper structure. Unstructured textual data are written content that lacks metadata and cannot readily be indexed or mapped onto standard database fields. So natural language processing and machine learning can be used to categorize unstructured textual data. So, lots of companies who have unstructured data can use this method to extract a lot of useful information, which can bring value to their products or performance. Text clusterer can use NLP methods to identify in which cluster the corpus of texts should be kept. Dataset of articles are used as input. We have used the Word2Vec method of NLP with K-Means for the clustering of the data. The aim of the project is to provide valuable information from the less structured data prevalent in the form of texts.
